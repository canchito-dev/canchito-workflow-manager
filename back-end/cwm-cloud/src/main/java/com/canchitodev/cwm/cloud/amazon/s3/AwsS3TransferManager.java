/**
 * This sample demonstrates how to make basic requests to Amazon S3 using the AWS SDK for Java.
 * 
 * <b>Prerequisites:</b> You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer account, and be signed up to use 
 * Amazon S3. For more information on Amazon S3, see http://aws.amazon.com/s3.
 * 
 * Depending on the size of the data you are uploading, Amazon S3 offers the following options:
 * 	- Upload objects in a single operation: With a single PUT operation, you can upload objects up to 5 GB in size.
 * 	- Upload objects in parts: Using the multipart upload API, you can upload large objects, up to 5 TB.
 * 
 * This class focuses on operations using the multipart upload API, which is designed to improve the upload experience 
 * for larger objects. You can upload objects in parts. These object parts can be uploaded independently, in any order, 
 * and in parallel. You can use a multipart upload for objects from 5 MB to 5 TB in size.
 * 
 * We recommend that you use multipart uploading in the following ways:
 * 	- If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multipart uploading to maximize the 
 * 	  use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance.
 * 	- If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multipart uploading to increase resiliency to network errors by 
 * 	  avoiding upload restarts. When using multipart uploading, you need to retry uploading only parts that are interrupted during the upload. You don't need to restart uploading your object from the beginning.
