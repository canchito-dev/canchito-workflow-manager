/**
 * This sample demonstrates how to make basic requests to Amazon S3 using the
 * AWS SDK for Java.
 * <p>
 * <b>Prerequisites:</b> You must have a valid Amazon Web Services developer
 * account, and be signed up to use Amazon S3. For more information on Amazon
 * S3, see http://aws.amazon.com/s3.
 * 
 * Depending on the size of the data you are uploading, Amazon S3 offers the following options:
 * 	- Upload objects in a single operation: With a single PUT operation, you can upload objects up to 5 GB in size.
 * 	- Upload objects in parts: Using the multipart upload API, you can upload large objects, up to 5 TB.
 * 
 * This class focuses on uploads using a single operation.
