/**
 * <p>The TaskQueueService is in charge of managing the different queues for executing TaskRunnable(s).
 * Remember that a TaskRunnable is generated from an asynchronous service invocation, and it is mainly
 * used for executing long-running tasks. The main purpose of the TaskQueueService is to solve the 
 * below points.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Quoted from Frederik Heremans comment (https://community.alfresco.com/thread/220468-modelling-an-async-user-wait-on-a-long-running-service-task):</p>
 * <i>When you have long-running tasks executed by Activiti's job-executor, you should consider that:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>
 * 			Executing a service-task (or any other task) keeps a transaction open until a wait-state/process-end/async-task 
 * 			is reached. If you have long-running operations, make sure your DB doesn't time out.
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 			When a jobs is running for 5 minutes, the job aquisistion-thread assumes the job-executor that was running the job, 
 * 			has either died or has failed. The lock of the job is removed and the job will be executed by another thread in the 
 * 			executor-pool. This timeout-setting can be  raised, if that is required.
 * 		</li>
 * 		<li>
 * 			Long-running tasks modeled IN the activiti-process always keep a transaction open and a job-executor thread occupied. 
 * 			Better practice is to use a queue-signal approach where the long-running operation is executed outside of Activit. When 
 * 			the long-running task is completed, it should signal the execution, which has a receive-task modeled in.
 * 		</li>
 * 	</ul>
