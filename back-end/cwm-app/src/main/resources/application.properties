# flowable.datasource.jdbc-max-checkout-time		= The amount of time in milliseconds a connection can be checked out from the connection pool before it is forcefully returned. Default is 20000 (20 seconds).

# spring.jpa.properties.*									= Additional native properties to set on the JPA provider.
# spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size			= Controls the maximum number of statements Hibernate will batch together before asking the driver to execute the batch. Zero or a negative 
#															  number disables this feature.
# spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_inserts				= Forces Hibernate to order inserts to allow for more batching to be used. Comes with a performance hit, so benchmark before and after to 
#															  see if this actually helps or hurts your application
# spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_updates				= Forces Hibernate to order SQL updates by the entity type and the primary key value of the items being updated. This allows for more batching 
#															  to be used. It will also result in fewer transaction deadlocks in highly concurrent systems. Comes with a performance hit, so benchmark 
#															  before and after to see if this actually helps or hurts your application.
# spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data	= Some JDBC drivers return incorrect row counts when a batch is executed. If your JDBC driver falls into this category this setting should 
#															  be set to false. Otherwise, it is safe to enable this which will allow Hibernate to still batch the DML for versioned entities and still 
#															  use the returned row counts for optimistic lock checks. Since 5.0, it defaults to true. Previously (versions 3.x and 4.x), it used to be false.

# flowable.async-executor.core-pool-size						= The minimal number of threads that are kept alive in the thread pool for job execution. Default is 2
# flowable.async-executor.max-pool-size							= The maximum number of threads that are created in the thread pool for job execution. Default is 10
# flowable.async-executor.thread-keep-alive-time				= The time (in milliseconds) a thread used for job execution must be kept alive before it is destroyed. Having a setting > 0 takes resources, but in the case of many job executions it avoids creating new threads all the time. If 0, threads will be destroyed after they\u2019ve been used for job execution. Default is 5000
# flowable.async-executor.number-of-retries						= The number of times a job will be retried before it is moved to the deadletter table. Default is 3
# flowable.async-executor.max-timer-jobs-per-acquisition		= The number of timer jobs that are acquired in one query. Default value is 1, as this lowers the potential for optimistic locking exceptions. Larger values can perform better, but the chance of optimistic locking exceptions occurring between different engines becomes larger too. Default is 1
# flowable.async-executor.max-async-jobs-due-per-acquisition	= The number of async jobs that are acquired during one query. Default value is 1, as this lowers the potential for optimistic locking exceptions. Larger values can perform better, but the chance of optimistic locking exceptions occurring between different engines becomes larger too. Default is 1
# flowable.async-executor.default-async-job-acquire-wait-time	= The time (in milliseconds) the timer acquisition thread will wait to execute the next query. This happens when no new timer jobs are found or when less timer jobs have been fetched than set in asyncExecutorMaxTimerJobsPerAcquisition. Default is 10000
# flowable.async-executor.default-timer-job-acquire-wait-time	= The time (in milliseconds) the async job acquisition thread will wait to execute the next query. This happens when no new async jobs were found or when less async jobs have been fetched than set in asyncExecutorMaxAsyncJobsDuePerAcquisition. Default is 10000
# flowable.async-executor.default-queue-size-full-wait-time		= The time (in milliseconds) the async job (both timer and async continuations) acquisition thread will wait when the internal job queue is full to execute the next query. By default set to 0 (for backwards compatibility). Setting this property to a higher value allows the async executor to hopefully clear its queue a bit. Default is 0
# flowable.async-executor.timer-lock-time-in-millis				= The amount of time (in milliseconds) a timer job is locked when acquired by the async executor. During this period of time, no other async executor will try to acquire and lock this job. Default is 300000
# flowable.async-executor.async-job-lock-time-in-millis			= The amount of time (in milliseconds) an async job is locked when acquired by the async executor. During this period of time, no other async executor will try to acquire and lock this job. Default is 300000
# flowable.async-executor.seconds-to-wait-on-shutdown			= The time (in seconds) that is waited to gracefully shut down the thread pool used for job execution when a shutdown on the executor (or process engine) is requested. Default is 60000
# flowable.async-executor.reset-expired-jobs-interval			= The amount of time (in milliseconds) that is between two consecutive checks of expired jobs. Expired jobs are jobs that were locked (a lock owner + time was written by some executor, but the job was never completed). During such a check, jobs that are expired are made available again, meaning the lock owner and lock time will be removed. Other executors will now be able to pick it up. A job is deemed expired if the lock time is before the current date. Default is 60000
# flowable.async-executor.reset-expired-jobs-page-size			= The amount of jobs that are fetched at once by the reset expired thread of the async executor. Default is 3

# flowable.check-process-definitions			= Whether to automatically deploy resources. Can be true (deploy) of false (not deploy). Default is true
# flowable.history-level						= Following history levels can be configured:
# 										  		  none: skips all history archiving. This is the most performant for runtime process execution, but no historical information will be available.
# 										  		  activity: archives all process instances and activity instances. At the end of the process instance, the latest values of the top level process instance variables will be copied to historic variable instances. No details will be archived.
# 										  		  audit: This is the default. It archives all process instances, activity instances, keeps variable values continuously in sync and all form properties that are submitted so that all user interaction through forms is traceable and can be audited.
# 										  		  full: This is the highest level of history archiving and hence the slowest. This level stores all information as in the audit level plus all other possible details, mostly this are process variable updates.
# flowable.custom-mybatis-mappers				= The FQN of custom Mybatis mappers that need to be added to the engine.

#												  See https://www.flowable.org/docs/userguide/index.html#advanced.safe.bpmn.xml. Unfortunately, this feature is not available on some platforms (JDK 6, JBoss), hence you need to disable if your 
#												  platform does not allow the use of StaxSource during XML parsing.
